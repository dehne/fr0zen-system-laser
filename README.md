# Fr0zenSystem Laser Edition
Fr0zenSystem is a little snowflake generator. It can generate any number of nice two-layer snowflake shapes. These can then be laser cut, the top layer from plain white paper and the bottom one from colored poster board. The top layer is only cut. The bottom, colored poster board layer, is both engraved to expose white or gray core and cut.

This version is a fork of the original project by [bleeptrack](https://twitter.com/Bleeptrack). (See [here](https://github.com/bleeptrack/fr0zen-system-laser).) In addition to commenting and reworking much of the code (hey, I'm a coder, okay?), it has been altered to make the output SVG files directly usable with the Glowforge laser cutter. It has also been extended to generate a specific unique snowflake for any specified name and birthday. If no name or birthday is supplied, it generates a new snowflake each time the "regenerate" button is pressed.

As was true of the original Fr0zen System, this version is probably useful for other laser cutters as well as pen- or cutter plotters.

On a Glowforge, white paper seems to cut well using 500 for speed and 30 for power. Poster board cuts at speed 500, power 40 and engraves well with 1000 speed and power 6 at 270 lpi. As always, paper cutting works best if the paper is first adhered to a piece of waste pasteboard (or cardboard) using laser-compatible, removable contact cement.
