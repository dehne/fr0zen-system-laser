# Fr0zenSystem Laser Edition
Fr0zenSystem is a little snowflake generator. This is a fork of the original project by [by bleeptrack](https://twitter.com/Bleeptrack). (See [here](https://github.com/bleeptrack/fr0zen-system-laser).) In addition to commenting and reworking much of the code (hey, I'm a coder, okay?), it has been extended to include the ability to generate the unique snowflake for a specified name and birthday. It has also altered to make the output files directly usable with the Glowforge laser cutter. It is probably useful for other laser cutters as well as pen- or cutter plotters.

The idea is to cut out two different layers that in combination form a nice snowflake shape.
